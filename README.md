# ChebyshevDynamics

Fluid dynamics using Fourier and Chebyshev-based spectral methods in Julia.

This project is under development. 
Our goal is to create a spectral solver for the Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations 
in domains that are vertically bounded and horizontally periodic
that utilizes a hybrid Fourier-Chebyshev basis.

Our algorithm follows the recommendations of 
"[Spectral integration of linear boundary value problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2717)" by Divakar Viswanath.
